# Search Algorithms

This project is a collection of various search algorithms implemented in C.
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding
how different search algorithms work and how they can be used in real-world
applications.

## Linear Search

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that searches for a target value in
a list of values. It compares each element in the list with the target value
until it finds a match or reaches the end of the list.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Implementation

The following is an example of a linear search algorithm implemented in C:

```c
int linear_search(int arr[], int n, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value
within a **sorted array**. It compares the target value to the middle element of
the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements each time it does not
find a match.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Could be O(log n) if recursive implementation is used.

### Notes

- Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
- The array must be sorted for binary search to work.
- Binary search is more efficient than linear search for large arrays.

### Implementation

The following is an example of a binary search algorithm implemented in C:

```c
/* recursive implementation */

int binary_search_recursive(int *array, size_t low, size_t high, int value)
{
    size_t mid;

    if (low > high)
        return (-1);

    mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    if (array[mid] == value)
        return (mid);

    else if (array[mid] < value)
        return (binary_search_recursive(array, mid + 1, high, value));

    else
        return (binary_search_recursive(array, low, mid - 1, value));
}

int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value)
{
    if (array == NULL || size == 0)
        return (-1);

    return (binary_search_recursive(array, 0, size - 1, value));
}
```

```c
/* iterative implementation */

int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value)
{
    size_t low, high, mid;

    if (array == NULL || size == 0)
        return (-1);

    low = 0;
    high = size - 1;

    while (low <= high)
    {
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (array[mid] == value)
            return (mid);

        else if (array[mid] < value)
            low = mid + 1;

        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }

    return (-1);
}
```
